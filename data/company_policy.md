## 1. LEAVE TYPES AND ACCRUAL

### 1.1 Vacation Leave
All full-time employees accrue vacation leave based on their years of service:
- **0-2 years**: 10 days (80 hours) per year
- **3-5 years**: 15 days (120 hours) per year
- **6+ years**: 20 days (160 hours) per year

Vacation hours accrue at a rate of 0.0385 hours per hour worked (for 10 days/year) and scale proportionally for higher tiers.

### 1.2 Sick Leave
All full-time employees receive 8 days (64 hours) of sick leave per year, accruing evenly throughout the year.

### 1.3 Annual Quotas
Each employee has a maximum annual quota that cannot be exceeded:
- **Vacation**: Based on years of service (10, 15, or 20 days)
- **Sick Leave**: 8 days maximum per calendar year

## 2. REQUEST LIMITATIONS AND BUSINESS RULES

### 2.1 The 60% Rule (Section 2.1)
**CRITICAL RULE**: Employees cannot use more than 60% of their annual vacation allowance in a single request. This rule applies to vacation leave only, not sick leave.

**Examples**:
- Employee with 10 days annual quota: Maximum 6 days in one request
- Employee with 15 days annual quota: Maximum 9 days in one request
- Employee with 20 days annual quota: Maximum 12 days in one request

This policy ensures adequate leave distribution throughout the year and maintains operational coverage.

### 2.2 Frequency Limits (Section 2.2)
Employees are restricted to no more than **2 "long vacations"** (defined as greater than 1 week/7 consecutive days) within any **2-month (60-day) rolling period**.

**Calculation Method**:
- Count all vacation requests exceeding 7 consecutive days
- Check if more than 2 such requests fall within any 60-day window
- If yes, the new request will be denied with reference to this section

**Rationale**: This prevents scheduling conflicts and ensures fair distribution of extended time off among the workforce.

### 2.3 Blackout Periods (Section 2.3)
Certain periods are designated as blackout periods where vacation requests are restricted or require special approval:

**Fiscal Quarter End Blackouts**:
- Last 2 weeks of March (Q1 end)
- Last 2 weeks of June (Q2 end)
- Last 2 weeks of September (Q3 end)
- **Extended Period**: November 15 - December 31 (Year-end closing and planning)

During blackout periods, vacation requests are automatically denied unless:
- The request is for less than 3 days
- Emergency circumstances with manager approval
- Pre-approved during annual planning cycle

**Blackout Period Dates (2024-2025)**:
- Q1: March 18 - March 31
- Q2: June 17 - June 30
- Q3: September 16 - September 30
- Year-end: November 15 - December 31

### 2.4 Notice Period Requirements (Section 2.4)
Employees must provide minimum advance notice based on leave duration:

- **1-3 days**: Minimum 5 business days notice
- **4-7 days**: **Minimum 2 weeks (14 calendar days) notice**
- **8+ days**: Minimum 3 weeks (21 calendar days) notice

**Notice Calculation**: Count from the date of request submission to the first day of requested leave. Weekends and holidays count in calendar days, but business days are preferred for planning purposes.

**Late Requests**: Requests submitted with insufficient notice may be denied or require manager override approval.

## 3. REQUEST PROCESS

### 3.1 Submission Requirements
All leave requests must include:
1. Employee ID
2. Leave type (Vacation or Sick)
3. Start date and end date (inclusive)
4. Total number of days/hours requested
5. Brief reason (optional for vacation, required for sick leave >3 days)

### 3.2 Approval Workflow
1. **Balance Check**: System verifies sufficient accrued balance
2. **Policy Compliance**: System checks against all business rules (60% rule, frequency limits, blackout periods, notice period)
3. **Manager Notification**: Approved requests generate email to manager
4. **Confirmation**: Employee receives inline confirmation with approved dates and remaining balance

### 3.3 Denial Process
When a request is denied, the system provides:
- Specific policy section(s) violated
- Explanation of the violation
- Alternative options when applicable (e.g., "Option A: Reduce days to comply with 60% rule; Option B: Shift dates to avoid blackout period")

---

## 4. BALANCE TRACKING

### 4.1 Accrual Tracking
Balances are tracked in both days and hours for flexibility:
- **1 day = 8 hours** (standard full-time workday)

### 4.2 Remaining Balance Queries
Employees can query their remaining balance at any time. The system displays:
- Vacation leave remaining (in days and hours)
- Sick leave remaining (in days and hours)
- Annual quota used (percentage)
- Upcoming scheduled leaves

### 4.3 Balance Reconciliation
Balances are reconciled monthly. Discrepancies should be reported to HR within 30 days.

---

## 5. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

### 5.1 Emergency Leave
For genuine emergencies, the notice period may be waived with manager approval. Blackout period restrictions still apply unless escalated to senior management.

### 5.2 Carryover Policy
Unused vacation leave up to 5 days may be carried over to the next calendar year if approved by manager before December 31. Unused sick leave does not carry over.

### 5.3 Manager Override
Managers have the authority to override policy restrictions in exceptional circumstances, subject to documented justification and HR notification.
